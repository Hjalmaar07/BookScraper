# BookScraper

This application scraps entire Books To Scrape website (https://books.toscrape.com/).
It downloads all pages and images and saves them on a desktop in a folder "ScrapedBooks".
There are no unit tests as i could not fin a reliable way to test functionallity with so many side effects.


Installation & running the app
There is no need to install anything. The folder for scraped website should be created automatically. There is no need to create it manually.

Application was developed and run on Windows 10. No testing on other platforms was done therefore proper functioning of the app is not guranateed.
